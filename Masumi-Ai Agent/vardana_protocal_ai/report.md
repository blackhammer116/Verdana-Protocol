**Tree Growth Monitoring**
-------------------------

Our team uses satellite imaging and remote sensing techniques to monitor the health and growth of your trees. We collect data on a weekly basis and analyze it using machine learning algorithms and statistical methods. This data is used to track your progress and provide you with insights on how to improve your tree growth.

**Carbon Token Earnings**
-------------------------

You earn carbon tokens based on the amount of CO2 sequestered by your trees. Each token represents a unit of CO2 offset. The more trees you plant and the healthier they grow, the more tokens you earn.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how carbon tokens are calculated:

* 1 tree grows for 1 year and sequesters 10 kg of CO2
* 1 token represents 1 kg of CO2 offset
* If your tree grows for 3 years, you earn 30 tokens (3 years \* 10 kg yr^-1 \* 1 token kg^-1)

**Utilizing Your Tokens**
-------------------------

Your carbon tokens can be used in various ways:

* **Trade**: Sell your tokens on our token exchange platform to receive fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies.
* **Carbon Offset**: Use your tokens to offset your own carbon emissions or sell them to companies looking to reduce their carbon footprint.
* **Rewards**: Redeem your tokens for rewards, such as discounts on agricultural products, services, or even vacations.
